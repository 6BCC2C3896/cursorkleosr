# Active Context: KleoSr Cursor Rules System

## Current Work Focus

The current development priority is enhancing the Memory Bank system integration with other components. This includes:

1. Improving integration between Memory Bank and Matrix Protocol phases
2. Implementing automatic update triggers for documentation
3. Developing visualization tools for Memory Bank relationships
4. Creating comprehensive usage examples for Memory Bank

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Completion (Version 6.0.0)
- ✅ Memory Bank commands implemented (`@memory/update`, `@memory/view`, `@memory/check`)
- ✅ Memory Bank notepad integration implemented
- ✅ Memory Bank validation system created
- ✅ Memory Bank automation integrated with workflow
- ✅ Updated all relevant documentation to reflect completed Memory Bank

### Memory Bank Implementation (Version 5.2.0)
- Added KleoSr Memory Bank for persistent project documentation
- Created `.cursor/rules/core/memory-bank.mdc` specification
- Created initial memory-bank directory with core files
- Updated README with Memory Bank documentation
- Updated index.mdc with Memory Bank reference
- Added `@file:memory` reference to command system

### AI Chat Rules (Version 5.1.0)
- Added AI Chat Rules system for standardized AI interactions
- Created `.cursor/rules/core/ai-chat-rules.mdc` specification
- Updated command system with @ai/rules command
- Enhanced README with AI chat rules documentation

### MDC Reorganization (Version 5.0.0)
- Reorganized MDC files into semantic directory structure
- Simplified all MDC files to reduce token usage
- Standardized MDC file format and structure

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Sprint)
1. Enhance integration between Memory Bank and Matrix Protocol phases
2. Implement automatic update triggers for documentation
3. Create comprehensive usage examples for Memory Bank
4. Test Memory Bank with real-world project development

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. Develop visualization tools for Memory Bank relationships
2. Implement AI-assisted Memory Bank maintenance
3. Create metrics for documentation completeness
4. Add cross-project Memory Bank sharing capabilities

### Long-term (Future Roadmap)
1. Integrate with external documentation systems
2. Implement natural language querying of Memory Bank
3. Create analytics for documentation quality
4. Develop automated documentation generation from codebase

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Integration
The Memory Bank now integrates with all core systems through:
- Command system integration with `@memory/` commands
- Notepad integration with `@notepad:memory` commands
- Validation system for consistency checking
- Workflow automation for documentation updates

### Documentation Update Approach
Implemented a hybrid approach for documentation updates:
- Manual triggers through `@memory/update` command
- Automatic triggers integrated with workflow automation
- Validation system to ensure consistency
- Progress tracking in progress.md

### Integration with Matrix Protocol
Memory Bank now informs all Matrix Protocol phases through:
- ANALYZE: Drawing context from Memory Bank
- CONCEPTUALIZE: Referencing documented patterns
- BLUEPRINT: Creating plans that align with documented patterns
- CONSTRUCT: Executing according to documented standards
- VALIDATE: Ensuring implementation matches Memory Bank standards

### Future Enhancement Prioritization
Based on user feedback, the following enhancements are prioritized:
1. Visualization tools for relationships (highest priority)
2. Automatic update triggers
3. AI-assisted maintenance
4. Cross-project sharing

This document should be updated at the start of each development session and whenever the current focus changes significantly.
