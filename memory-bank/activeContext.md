# Active Context: KleoSr Cursor Rules System

## Current Work Focus

The current development priority is implementing and testing the Memory Bank system. This includes:

1. Creating the initial Memory Bank file structure
2. Developing template documentation for each core file
3. Updating the system documentation to reference the Memory Bank
4. Testing the Memory Bank with actual project development

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Implementation (Version 5.2.0)
- Added KleoSr Memory Bank for persistent project documentation
- Created `.cursor/rules/core/memory-bank.mdc` specification
- Created initial memory-bank directory with core files
- Updated README with Memory Bank documentation
- Updated index.mdc with Memory Bank reference
- Added `@file:memory` reference to command system

### AI Chat Rules (Version 5.1.0)
- Added AI Chat Rules system for standardized AI interactions
- Created `.cursor/rules/core/ai-chat-rules.mdc` specification
- Updated command system with @ai/rules command
- Enhanced README with AI chat rules documentation

### MDC Reorganization (Version 5.0.0)
- Reorganized MDC files into semantic directory structure
- Simplified all MDC files to reduce token usage
- Standardized MDC file format and structure

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Current Sprint)
1. Complete Memory Bank implementation with example data
2. Test Memory Bank with real project development
3. Document usage patterns for Memory Bank integration
4. Create command system shortcuts for Memory Bank operations

### Medium-term (Next 2-3 Sprints)
1. Enhance Memory Bank with automatic update triggers
2. Integrate Memory Bank with Matrix Protocol phases
3. Develop visualization tools for Memory Bank relationships
4. Create templates for common project types

### Long-term (Future Roadmap)
1. Implement AI-assisted Memory Bank maintenance
2. Develop cross-project Memory Bank sharing
3. Create metrics for documentation completeness
4. Integrate with external documentation systems

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Structure
The decision to use a hierarchical file structure for the Memory Bank was made to balance completeness with usability. Alternative approaches considered:
- Single file (rejected due to size limitations)
- Database approach (rejected due to complexity)
- Wiki-style (considered for future enhancement)

### Documentation Update Frequency
Current approach requires manual triggers for documentation updates. Considering:
- Automatic updates after significant code changes
- Scheduled periodic review prompts
- Integration with git hooks for enforcement

### Integration with Matrix Protocol
The Memory Bank should inform all Matrix Protocol phases, particularly:
- ANALYZE: Drawing context from Memory Bank
- BLUEPRINT: Creating plans that align with documented patterns
- VALIDATE: Ensuring implementation matches Memory Bank standards

### Command Interface Extensions
Considering additional commands for Memory Bank operations:
- `@memory/update`: Trigger Memory Bank update process
- `@memory/view`: Display Memory Bank documents
- `@memory/check`: Validate Memory Bank completeness

This document should be updated at the start of each development session and whenever the current focus changes significantly.
