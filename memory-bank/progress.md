- ðŸ”² Testing and refinement in progress

### Velocity Metrics
- **Previous Sprint**: 5 key deliverables completed
- **Current Sprint**: 3/4 key deliverables completed
- **Next Sprint**: 4 key deliverables planned

## Known Issues

### Memory Bank Implementation
1. **Consistency Check**: Need to implement validation to ensure Memory Bank files remain consistent with each other
   - Severity: Medium
   - Status: To Do
   - Planned Fix: Sprint 3

2. **Command Integration**: Memory Bank commands not yet integrated into command system
   - Severity: Low
   - Status: In Progress
   - Planned Fix: Current Sprint

### Documentation
1. **Usage Examples**: Need more comprehensive examples of Memory Bank usage
   - Severity: Low
   - Status: To Do
   - Planned Fix: Sprint 2

2. **Markdown Rendering**: Some Mermaid diagrams may not render correctly in all environments
   - Severity: Low
   - Status: Known Issue
   - Planned Fix: Considering alternatives

### Integration
1. **IDE Support**: Full functionality requires Cursor IDE
   - Severity: Medium
   - Status: By Design
   - Planned Fix: No fix planned, document limitation

This document should be updated at the end of each development session and whenever significant progress is made or new issues are identified.
