# Project Brief: KleoSr Cursor Rules System

## Project Purpose
The KleoSr Cursor Rules System provides a comprehensive, structured approach to AI-assisted development within the Cursor IDE. It implements standardized workflows, documentation practices, and interaction patterns to maximize development efficiency and code quality.

## Core Requirements
1. Provide a structured workflow system for AI-assisted development
2. Maintain consistent documentation and context between sessions
3. Establish clear boundaries and operational procedures for AI assistants
4. Ensure code quality through standardized practices
5. Support complex project development with minimal context loss

## Key Goals
- Enhance developer productivity through standardized AI workflows
- Reduce errors and inconsistencies in AI-assisted development
- Provide persistent project intelligence across sessions
- Establish clear communication protocols between developers and AI
- Create a reusable framework applicable to various project types

## Target Audience
- Software developers using Cursor IDE
- Development teams seeking standardized AI-assisted workflows
- Technical leads implementing coding standards

## Success Metrics
- Reduced development time for common tasks
- Improved code quality and consistency
- Enhanced documentation coverage
- Reduced context loss between AI sessions
- Successful adoption in multiple projects

## Out of Scope
- Non-Cursor IDE environments
- Integration with non-supported CI/CD systems
- Replacement for comprehensive project management tools

## Stakeholders
- KleoSr (Creator and maintainer)
- Cursor IDE community
- Adopting development teams
