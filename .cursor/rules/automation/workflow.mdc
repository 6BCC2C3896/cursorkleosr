# Workflow Automation

Automated task execution and process management for development workflows.

## Features

- Event-driven automation
- Command chaining
- Conditional execution
- Phase-based task grouping
- Progress tracking
- Memory Bank integration

## Triggers

Automation can be triggered by:
- Direct commands
- File system events
- Phase transitions
- Time-based schedules
- External events
- Memory Bank updates

## Implementation

The workflow system:
1. Monitors trigger conditions
2. Executes defined action sequences
3. Tracks progress and status
4. Reports results to appropriate outputs
5. Updates Memory Bank documentation
6. Performs consistency validation

## Usage

Use workflow automation to:
- Streamline repetitive tasks
- Enforce process consistency
- Maintain quality standards
- Reduce manual intervention
- Keep Memory Bank documentation current
- Validate documentation integrity

## Memory Bank Automation

The workflow system provides automatic management of Memory Bank:
- Triggers documentation updates after significant changes
- Validates cross-file consistency
- Prompts for updates to outdated information
- Synchronizes activeContext.md and progress.md
- Maintains documentation quality standards
