# Global Directives

Essential project-wide directives that apply to all operations.

## Core Directives

1. All .mdc rules in .cursor/rules take precedence and are always enforced
2. Default to TypeScript with strict type checking
3. Use context-aware documentation generation
4. Follow security-first development practices

## File Organization

- .mdc files organized by purpose in directories
- YAML frontmatter for metadata
- References through @file: commands

## Command Reference

See `.cursorrules` for the complete command reference
