# Sequential Thinking

Structured problem-solving through sequential thought steps to enhance reasoning.

## Features

- Maximum depth: 12 steps
- Parallel processing capability
- Confidence scoring
- Branching logic
- Self-correction mechanism

## Process

1. Break down complex problems into steps
2. Generate step-by-step solutions
3. Track confidence per step
4. Allow branching for alternative approaches
5. Review and refine solution paths

## Commands

- `@mcp/thinking` - Run sequential thinking
- `@notepad:thinking` - Run in notepad with visible steps

## Usage

For complex reasoning tasks, use the sequential thinking protocol to:
- Analyze trade-offs systematically
- Map dependencies between components
- Validate solution efficacy
- Document decision rationale
