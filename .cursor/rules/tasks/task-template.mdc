# Task Template

Standard structure for creating task-specific MDC files.

## Purpose

Provides a consistent format for task-specific guidance that focuses on particular workflows, processes, or development patterns.

## When To Use

Create a task-specific MDC when:
- A workflow needs standardization
- Multiple team members perform the same task
- A development pattern needs documentation
- Guidance is too specific for general rules

## Structure
