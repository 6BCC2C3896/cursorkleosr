# Cursor Natural AI Workflow 



## Overview

Transform your Cursor AI assistant into a true development partner with persistent memory and structured workflows. This system eliminates repetitive explanations and provides consistent, focused assistance by maintaining context throughout your development process.

### Key Benefits

- **Persistent Memory**: Your AI remembers project context and coding preferences
- **Structured Workflows**: Follows a logical progression from analysis to validation
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple tasks systematically without losing context
- **Plan Archiving**: Never lose track of your development plans and decisions
- **Git Integration**: Built-in version control support for better collaboration

## How It Works

The system utilizes just two configuration files to manage your AI's behavior:

### `project_config.md`
Your project's long-term memory containing:
- Project goals and requirements
- Technology stack and tool preferences
- Coding standards and patterns
- Performance constraints
- Token management settings

### `workflow_state.md`
The dynamic workspace that tracks:
- Current workflow phase
- Implementation plans and rules
- Activity logs and tool usage
- Task queues and results
- Historical blueprints for reference

## Workflow Process

    A[AI Initialization] --> B[Read workflow_state.md];
    B --> C{Task Available?};
    C -- Yes --> D[Process Next Task];
    C -- No --> E[Continue Current Work];
    E --> F[Execute Task];
    F --> G[Update workflow_state.md];
    G --> H{Validation Required?};
    H -- Yes --> I[Run Tests];
    H -- No --> E;
    D --> J{More Tasks?};
    J -- Yes --> K[Reset Workspace];
    K --> L[Start Fresh];
    L --> B;
    J -- No --> M[Mark Complete];
    M --> N[Idle State];
```

## Development Phases

1. **Understanding**: Requirements analysis without premature solutioning
2. **Planning**: Detailed step-by-step implementation with blueprint archiving
3. **Building**: Precise execution with error handling and systematic processing
4. **Validation**: Testing and verification against requirements

## Getting Started

1. **Locate Configuration Files**: Find `project_config.md` and `workflow_state.md` in the `cursorkleosr/` directory
2. **Configure Project**: Customize `project_config.md` with your project specifics
3. **Initialize AI**: Use this system prompt in Cursor:
   ```
   You're an autonomous AI developer. Work exclusively with project_config.md and workflow_state.md. 
   Before each action, read workflow_state.md to understand context, follow the rules, 
   then immediately update workflow_state.md with your actions and results.
   ```
4. **Begin Development**: The AI will initialize and request your first task

## Key Features

### Blueprint Archiving
Every plan is automatically archived with timestamps and unique IDs. Retrieve previous plans with natural language:
- "Show me last Tuesday's blueprint"
- "Use blueprint abc123def"
- "Display this week's plans"

### Git Integration
Seamless version control support with:
- Automated commit suggestions
- Progress tracking through commit logs
- Plain English rollback and comparison commands

### Cursor Rules Integration
While `.cursorrules` can still manage global preferences, the workflow intelligence now resides in your configuration files for more context-aware behavior.
