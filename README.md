  <p><em>Advanced Project Rules and Automation System</em></p>
</div>

## Introduction
This project implements a comprehensive rules and automation system using `.cursorrules` and `.cursor/rules` to ensure consistent development practices, automated workflows, and maintainable code quality. Part of the kleosr/cursorkleosr ecosystem.

## Project Description
The project uses two main configuration systems:
- `.cursorrules`: Project-wide directives, MCP configuration, and automation features
- `.cursor/rules`: Detailed rule sets with "Always" enforcement for specific development scenarios

## Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kleosr/cursorkleosr.git
   cd cursorkleosr
   ```

2. Configure Python environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   which uv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt || pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure rules:
   ```bash
   cp .cursorrules.example .cursorrules
   ```
